Hello and welcome :)

Most of us have New Year Resolutions and for 2021 I decided to learn a new programming language.
Python was the chosen one, and I will be sharing with you my learning journey.

## Why Python?
Python is a language with a simplified syntax, has a great online community and we can do lots of cool things with it:  
> Python is a general-purpose coding language—which means that can be used for other types of programming and software development besides web development. 
> That includes back end development, software development, data science and writing system scripts among other things.

## How do you plan to study?
The CodeCademy Python 3 course will be my main source of learning.
I choose it because their text based platform, makes it easier to learn with I stream and take notes as I go.
Part of my studies will happen while I stream [Twitch Channel](https://twitch.tv/pachicodes), but I will be studying everyday.
I will join the #100DaysOfCode community on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pachicodes) as a way to keep myself accountable and connect with other learners.

  

## Why are you learning it with an audience?
As a community oriented person, I want to make friends while I learn, and have other people learning with me.
This way I can get help when I am stuck and have motivation and support when I get tired or frustrated.
  

## What are your goals?
 - Document my process with a [Github Repository](https://github.com/pachicodes/pachi-learns-python) ,
 - Write blog posts with that I learned,
 - Share on my [Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/c/pachicodes) clips with my “aha” moments.  

By the end of this Project, I intent to have study material to share with the community.
I am also planing a final project where I can use my gained skills and apply [New Relic](http://bit.ly/sponsoredbynewrelic) to it.

  
## Final Considerations
I want to make learning fun and an interactive experience. 
**Let's do this together!**
Join me on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/pachicodes) on Mondays and Thursdays at 9am EST to learn with me (or help me learn).

Thanks for reading, and I hope to "see" you there,

XOXO

Pachi C.
