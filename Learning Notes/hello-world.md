## Hello, world!
### Comments
Comments are text that won't be read by the program.
You can write comments on Python writting after a #

### Atithmetic Operations
Python supports all the basic math operations:
+ for addition
- for subtraction
* for multiplication
/ for division
% for modulus (returns the remainder of a division)
** for exponentiation

### Plus-Equals Operator +=
It is a way to add value to an existing variable. 
So in:
```
number = 7
number += 10
```
Number will be 17, because we added 10 to 7.

### Variables
Variables store data.
In Python you don't need to use any key work, just your variable name, = , what you want to store as a variable.
``` 
number = 7
```

### String Concatenation
Python, like JavaScript, supports the joining (concatenation) of strings together using the + operator.
The code above will return Hello you.

```
word = "hello "
name = "you"

word + You
```

### Zero Division Error
Python will throw an error if you try to use 0 as a denominator in a division.

### Strings
Strings are a sequenceces of characters inside quotation mark. You can use single or double quotations

### print() Function 
The print() Function prints things on the console.

### input() Function
The input function allos the user to ender an input.
You can also add a text to it, to prompt the user to enter their input.

```
input("Hi, please enetr your name: ")
```

*Note that inputs assume that the type is string. SO if you want a number, you have to parse yhe input into a number type*
