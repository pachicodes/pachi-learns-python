### Boolean Values
Booleans are a data type in Python, much like integers, floats, and strings. However, booleans only have two values:

    True
    False


### not Operator
The Python Boolean not operator is used in a Boolean expression in order to evaluate the expression to its inverse value. If the original expression was True, including the not operator would make the expression False, and vice versa.


### or Operator
The Python **or** operator combines two Boolean and if at least one is True, it returns True.
If both expressions are False, then the entire expression is False.

### and Operator
The Python **and** operator performs a Boolean comparison between two Boolean. Both have to be true fot the expession to be True. If one if False, the expression returns False.


### Equal Operator ==
The equal operator, ==, is used to compare two values, variables or expressions to determine if they are the exactly the same.
If they are, the operator returns True, otherwise it returns False.

### Not Equals Operator !=
The Python not equals operator, !=, is used to compare two values, variables or expressions to determine if they are NOT the same. If they are NOT the same, the operator returns True. If they are the same, then it returns False.


### Comparison Operators
In Python, relational operators compare two values or expressions. The most common ones are:

    < less than
    > greater than
    <= less than or equal to
    >= greater than or equal too


### if Statement
The Python if statement is used to determine the execution of code based on the evaluation of a Boolean expression.

    If the if statement expression evaluates to True, then the indented code following the statement is executed.
    If the expression evaluates to False then the indented code following the if statement is skipped and the program executes the next line of code which is indented at the same level as the if statement.


### elif Statement
The Python elif statement (similar to JavaScript Else if) allows for continued checks to be performed after an initial if statement. 

### else Statement
The Python else statement provides alternate code to execute if the expression in an if statement evaluates to False.
