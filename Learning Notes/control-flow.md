- or Operator

The Python or operator combines two Boolean expressions and evaluates to True if at least one of the expressions returns True. Otherwise, if both expressions are False, then the entire expression evaluates to False.

- elif Statement

The Python elif statement allows for continued checks to be performed after an initial if statement. An elif statement differs from the else statement because another expression is provided to be checked, just as with the initial if statement.


- Handling Exceptions in Python

A try and except block can be used to handle error in code block. Code which may raise an error can be written in the try block. During execution, if that code block raises an error, the rest of the try block will cease executing and the except code block will execute.


- Equal Operator ==

The equal operator, ==, is used to compare two values, variables or expressions to determine if they are the same.

If the values being compared are the same, the operator returns True, otherwise it returns False.


- Not Equals Operator !=

The Python not equals operator, !=, is used to compare two values, variables or expressions to determine if they are NOT the same. If they are NOT the same, the operator returns True. If they are the same, then it returns False.



- Comparison Operators

In Python, relational operators compare two values or expressions. The most common ones are:

    < less than
    > greater than
    <= less than or equal to
    >= greater than or equal too


- if Statement

The Python if statement is used to determine the execution of code based on the evaluation of a Boolean expression.

    If the if statement expression evaluates to True, then the indented code following the statement is executed.
    If the expression evaluates to False then the indented code following the if statement is skipped and the program executes the next line of code which is indented at the same level as the if statement.



- else Statement

The Python else statement provides alternate code to execute if the expression in an if statement evaluates to False.


- and Operator

The Python and operator performs a Boolean comparison between two Boolean values, variables, or expressions. If both sides of the operator evaluate to True then the and operator returns True. If either side (or both sides) evaluates to False, then the and operator returns False. A non-Boolean value (or variable that stores a value) will always evaluate to True when used with the and operator.

- Boolean Values

Booleans are a data type in Python, much like integers, floats, and strings. However, booleans only have two values:

    True
    False


- not Operator

The Python Boolean not operator is used in a Boolean expression in order to evaluate the expression to its inverse value. If the original expression was True, including the not operator would make the expression False, and vice versa.

not True     # Evaluates to False
not False    # Evaluates to True
1 > 2        # Evaluates to False
not 1 > 2    # Evaluates to True
1 == 1       # Evaluates to True
not 1 == 1   # Evaluates to False
